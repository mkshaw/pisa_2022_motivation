# PISA 2022 Motivation During School Closures

This repository is dedicated to a machine learning project for EDPE 668: Advanced Seminar in Learning Sciences. Specifically, it contains data and code related to an analysis of motivation during school closures in the PISA 2022 data set (downloadable here: https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/) using random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB) algorithms.

## Research Questions

1. How well do the RF and GB algorithms predict struggling with motivation during COVID school closures, as measured by mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, precision, recall, and F1 scores?
2. What features are important for predicting struggling with motivation during COVID school closures?
